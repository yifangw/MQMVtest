\title{mean-variance-based method for unrelated individuals:TpMV, simultaneously test for differences in both the means and variances of a quantitative trait.}
\usage{
TpMV_test(
  Genotype,
  Y,
  Sex,
  Covariate = NULL,
  missing_cutoff = 0.15,
  MAF_Cutoff = NULL,
  MGC_Cutoff = 20,
  method = "joint"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Genotype}{A numeric genotype matrix with each row as a different individual and each column as a separate SNP.
Each genotype is coded as 0, 1 or 2 for females and coded as 0 or 1 for males, indicating the number of reference allele.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector of a quantitative trait, such as height.}

\item{Sex}{A vector of the genetic sex following PLINK default coding, where males are coded as 1 and females are coded as 2.}

\item{Covariate}{ptional: a vector or a matrix of covariates, such as age.}

\item{missing_cutoff}{Cutoff of the missing rates of SNPs (default=0.15). Any SNPs with missing rates higher than the cutoff will be excluded from the analysis.}

\item{MAF_Cutoff}{MAF cutoff for common vs. rare variants (default=NULL). It should be a numeric value between 0 and 0.5, or NULL.}

\item{MGC_Cutoff}{Cutoff for the minimum genotype count in either females or males.}

\item{method}{Optional: A character string indicating which kind of association tests is to be conducted.
There are four options: "Tplinkw", "scale", "joint" (default) and "all".
method="Tplinkw": Tplinkw; method="scale": wM3VNA; method="joint": TpMV; method="all": all of the above association tests.}
}
\value{
The p values and the test statistics of association tests selected by the method option for each SNP.
}
\description{
A function to obtain the p value and the test statistics of the Tplinkw_test (i.e., Tplinkw), the scale test (i.e.,wM3VNA) from the "QMVtest" package, the TpMV_test(i.e., TpMV) or all.
